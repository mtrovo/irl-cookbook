# Pizza dough

## Ingredients
- 1 kg white bread flour or Tipo '00' flour , or 800g strong white bread
  flour or Tipo '00' flour, plus 200g finely ground semolina flour
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 2 x 7 g dried yeast sachets
- 1 tablespoon golden caster sugar
- 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

## Method
- Sieve the flour/s and salt on to a clean work surface and make a well
  in the middle.
- In a jug, mix the yeast, sugar and oil into 650ml of lukewarm water
  and leave for a few minutes, then pour into the well.
- Using a fork, bring the flour in gradually from the sides and swirl it
  into the liquid. Keep mixing, drawing larger amounts of flour in, and
  when it all starts to come together, work the rest of the flour in
  with your clean, flour-dusted hands. Knead until you have a smooth,
  springy dough.
- Place the ball of dough in a large flour-dusted bowl and flour the
  top of it. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and place in a warm room
  for about an hour until the dough has doubled in size.
- Now remove the dough to a flour-dusted surface and knead it around a
  bit to push the air out with your hands – this is called knocking back
  the dough. You can either use it immediately, or keep it, wrapped in
  clingfilm, in the fridge (or freezer) until required.
- If using straight away, divide the dough up into as many little balls
  as you want to make pizzas – this amount of dough is enough to make
  about six to eight medium pizzas.
- Timing-wise, it’s a good idea to roll the pizzas out about 15 to 20
  minutes before you want to cook them. Don’t roll them out and leave them
  hanging around for a few hours, though – if you are working in advance
  like this it’s better to leave your dough, covered with clingfilm, in
  the fridge. However, if you want to get them rolled out so there’s one
  less thing to do when your guests are round, simply roll the dough out
  into rough circles, about 0.5cm thick, and place them on slightly larger
  pieces of olive-oil-rubbed and flour-dusted tin foil. You can then stack
  the pizzas, cover them with clingfilm, and pop them into the fridge.

## Tips
This dough is best made with Italian Tipo ‘00’ flour, which is finer ground
than normal flour, and it will give your dough an incredible super-smooth
texture. Look for it in Italian delis and good supermarkets. If using white
bread flour instead, make sure it’s a strong one that’s high in gluten, as
this will transform into a lovely, elastic dough, which is what you want.
Mix in some semolina flour for a bit of colour and flavour, if you like.
