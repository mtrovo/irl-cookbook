# Gemelli w/ Sausage & Cherry Tomatoes


## Ingredients
- 250g gemelli pasta, boiled for 1 minute less than package directions.
- 1 T. olive oil
- 500g mild Italian turkey sausage, casings removed
- Â¼ c. white wine, preferably Pinot Gris
- 10-12 cherry tomatoes
- Italian parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions
- Bring a large pot of water to a rolling bowl and salt it generously. Boil 
  the gemelli for 1 minute less than the package directs.
- Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil. Brown the
  sausage, breaking it up into bits about the size of a large pea. Deglaze
  the pan with the white wine and add the cherry tomatoes. Add 2 T. of water
  and cover to help the tomatoes start to break down. Cook for 5-7 minutes,
  breaking up the tomatoes to release their juices.
- Add the pasta and stir to coat evenly with sauce. Cook for 1 additional
  minute. The pasta should start to absorb the sauce a bit. Serve in bowls
  and garnish with parsley.
